##Please write a program which asks the user for four numbers. The program then prints out the sum and the mean of the numbers.

num1 = int(input("Number 1"))
num2 = int(input("Number 2"))
num3 = int(input("Number 3"))
num4 = int(input("Number 4"))

sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4
mean = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4) / 4

print(f"The sum of the numbers is {sum} and the mean is {mean}")
