##Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater. If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.

num1 = int(input("Please input the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please input another number: "))

if num1 > num2:
    print(f"The greater number was: {num1}")
elif num2 > num1:
    print(f"The greater number was: {num2}")
else:
    print("The numbers are equal!")
