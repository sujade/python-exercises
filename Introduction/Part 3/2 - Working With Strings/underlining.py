#Please write a program which asks the user for strings using a loop. The program prints out each string underlined as shown in the examples below. The execution ends when the user inputs an empty string - that is, just presses Enter at the prompt.

while True:
    string = input("Please type in a string: ")
    if string == "":
        break
    print(string)
    print('-' * len(string))
